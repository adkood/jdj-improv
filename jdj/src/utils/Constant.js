This method is commonly used to produce a variety of copper-based components and products with complex shapes and intricate details. Copper casting can be performed using several techniques, each suited to different applications and production requirements. Some common methods of copper casting include:`, short: 'Casting is a manufacturing process in which molten material, like metal, is poured into a mold and allowed to harden.', advantage: ["Continuous production of soft annealed copper.",

This process involves forcing a billet or cylindrical rod of copper through a shaped die, resulting in the copper taking on the shape of the die's profile. The extrusion process typically involves heating the copper billet to a temperature where it becomes malleable but not molten, making it easier to shape.'`, advantage: ["Continuous production of soft annealed copper in different shapes.",
